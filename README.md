GuessTheFlag

GuessTheFlag is a fun SwiftUI-based iOS app that challenges you to identify the correct flag from a set of options. 

Upon launching the app, you will be greeted with a title "Guess the Flag" and three flag images.
Tap on the flag you believe corresponds to the country name displayed at the top of the screen.
Instantly receive feedback on your selection, whether it's correct or not.
Your current score will be displayed at the bottom of the screen, updating with each correct answer.
